<h3>1. The Need for Communication (1950s–1960s)</h3>
<body>
  <p>During the Cold War, the United States wanted a way to communicate and share information between computers, even if part of the network</p>
  
So, the idea was;
<ul><li>Computers should be connected
  </li>
  <li>Information should travel quickly</li>
  <li>The network should not depend on one central point</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    2. 1969: Birth of ARPANET (the first real step
  </h3>
  <p>The US Department of Defense (through ARPA, now called DARPA) created ARPANET — the very first network using packet switching.</p>
<ul> <li>On October 29, 1969, the first message was sent between two computers: one at UCLA and one at Stanford.</li>
<li>The first message was supposed to be "LOGIN", but it crashed after just "LO" — still, it worked!</li>
</ul>
<p>ARPANET connected only a few university and research computers at first.</p>
<h3>3. 1970s: Email and more connections</h3>
  <ul><li>1971: First email was sent (by Ray Tomlinson).</li>
  <li>Scientists kept improving the system and connecting more computers.</li></ul>
  <h3>4. January 1, 1983: The official "birthday" of the modern internet</h3>
  <p>All networks started using the same rules called TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol). This allowed different networks (from military, universities, companies) to connect and "talk" to each other — this became the Internet.</p>
  <h3>5. 1989–1991: The World Wide Web (what most people use today)</h3>
  <p>The internet existed, but it was hard to use — mostly text commands, no pictures or easy clicking.</p>
  <p>In 1989, a British scientist named Tim Berners-Lee (working at CERN in Switzerland) invented the World Wide Web:</p>
  <ul><li>Hyperlinks (clickable links)</li>
  <li>Web pages written in HTML</li><li>URLs (web addresses like www.example.com)</li><li>
    Web browser software to view pages
  </li></ul>
  <p>He made it free for everyone in 1993.</p>
  <h3>6. 1990s: Boom for normal people</h3>
  <ul><li>1993: First easy graphical browsers (like Mosaic, then Netscape) appeared → suddenly everyone could browse pictures, videos, and websites.</li>
  <li>Companies like AOL brought the internet to homes with dial-up modems.</li>
  <li>By late 1990s: millions of people online, websites everywhere.</li></ul>
